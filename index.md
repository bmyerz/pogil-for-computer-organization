title: Active Learning Materials for Computer Architecture & Organization
---

# The project

Surveys of computer science and engineering instructors have indicated that two of the common reasons they do not adopt research-based instruction strategies are preparation time and lack of materials. This lack of materials to support research-based instruction was evident in Computer Architecture & Organization (AR). We are creating, piloting, revising, and sharing activities inspired by Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). POGIL is a research-based instruction strategy that comprises self-managed teams, development of process skills, and activities designed based on a theory of instruction called learning cycles.

The exploration phase asks students to record the number of rows and inputs of truth tables, the concept invention phase asks them to infer the relationship of number of rows to number of inputs, and the application phase asks them to use this concept in a new problem." />

# The activities

These activities are under active development and in use with 120 students per semester.

* Memory organization of programs
* Stored programs
* Procedure calls

## Activities on digital design and microarchitecture

* Combinational logic
* Adders and delay
* Adders, shifters, multipliers
* Sequential logic

* The Add Instruction
* Engineering digital systems

## Other information

* These activities are listed at [cspogil.org](http://cspogil.org/Architecture+and+Organization).
* To quickly determine whether an activity might fit into your course, take a look at the [learning objectives](docs/learning_objectives.pdf) for each activity.
* These activities are under active development and in use with 120 students per semester.
* To date, these have not been certified by the POGIL Project. However, they are the product of revisions made during a [POGIL Writer's Retreat](https://events.pogil.org/event-2783495) and are listed on CS-POGIL http://cspogil.org/Architecture+and+Organization.
