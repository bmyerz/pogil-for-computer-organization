title: Active Learning Materials for Computer Architecture & Organization
---

# The project

Surveys of computer science and engineering instructors have indicated that two of the common reasons they do not adopt research-based instruction strategies are preparation time and lack of materials. This lack of materials to support research-based instruction was evident in Computer Architecture & Organization (AR). We are creating, piloting, revising, and sharing activities inspired by Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). POGIL is a research-based instruction strategy that comprises self-managed teams, development of process skills, and activities designed based on a theory of instruction called learning cycles.

# The activities

The activities on architecture (Memory Organization of Programs, Stored Programs, Procedure Calls) use MIPS, following textbooks like _Harris & Harris, Digital Design and Computer Architecture, 2nd Ed, 2012_ and _Patterson & Hennessey, Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition, 5th Ed, 2014_. The activities on digital design could fit into any course on digital design or computer organization.

* Bits and numbers
* Memory organization of programs
* Stored programs
* Procedure calls
* Combinational logic
* Adders and delay
* Adders, shifters, multipliers
* Sequential logic
* Addressable memory and the add instruction
* Engineering digital systems
